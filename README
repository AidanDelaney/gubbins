This application takes in a multi fasta alignment, finds all the SNP sites, then outputs the snp sites in the following formats:
VCF, 
a multi fasta alignment,
relaxed phylib format.

The first sequence in the input file is taken as the reference.

To use:

multi_fasta_to_vcf my_file.aln


VCF
=====
This contains the position of each SNP in the reference sequence, and the occurance in each other sample.

Multi Fasta Alignment
=====
Similar to the input file but just containing the snpsites.

Relaxed Phylib format
=====
All the snpsites in a format for RAxML
