This piece of software is not the version that was used in Croucher et. al. "Rapid Pneumococcal Evolution in Response to Clinical Interventions", Science 2011, 331 (6016): 430-434.
It is a work in progress and as such is not yet recommended for use by the community. We expect to make an official release of the software soon.

## Building ##

The build system is used GNU Autotools.  From git you need to

```bash
$ autoreconf -i
$ ./configure
$ make
```

If you are building from a source release tarball, then the first step is unnecessary and the following will suffice:

```bash
$ ./configure
$ make
```
